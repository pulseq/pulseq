%% Compile mex files from MATLAB source
% This script is designed to compile frequently used Pulseq functions into
% mex files for faster execution.
%
% The Pulseq toolbox has been designed such that these files are *not*
% necessary to use the toolbox, but if they are present a substantial
% performance improvement can be achieved.
%
% The script relies on the MATLAB Coder package, available in later
% versions of MATLAB.
